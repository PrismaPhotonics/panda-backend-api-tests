## Issue Identified

⚠️ **The subfolders are NOT direct children of the main folder!**

The main folder only has 1 direct child:
- Drop 3 – Backend Test Plans

But the subfolders (01_Program_Overview, 02_Team_Management, etc.) exist and contain the documents, but they are not showing as direct children of the main folder.

**Possible causes:**
1. The subfolders were created but not properly linked to the main folder
2. The subfolders exist elsewhere in the space
3. There's a permission or visibility issue

**Next Steps:**
1. Check where the subfolders are actually located
2. Verify their parent relationships
3. Move them to be direct children of the main folder if needed

Subject: Sprint Bugs Review Meeting Summary - November 19, 2025

Hi Team,

Here's a summary of today's Sprint Bugs Review meeting:

**Status Overview:**
- Total bugs: 30
- Fixed: 0 (0%)
- Open: 30 (100%)
- Priority breakdown: 7 Highest, 10 High, 13 Medium

**Critical Finding:**
No bugs were fixed in the last sprint. We need to allocate dedicated time for bug fixes in the next sprint, especially focusing on Highest Priority bugs before Pre-FAT (November 30).

**Action Items:**

1. yonatan.rubin:
   - Add more details to PZ-14845 (No option to open analyzes after crash)
   - Add more details to PZ-14843 (Z pool disconnect under pressure)

2. Ohad Vaknin:
   - Verify if PZ-14712 (Focus Server pod restarts due to MongoDB) has already been fixed and update status

3. Oded Aviyam:
   - Re-check PZ-14926 (Job configuration not saved to MongoDB) and update status

4. Roy Avrahami:
   - Decide whether to add PZ-13986 (200 Jobs Capacity Issue) to Sprint 74

**Recommendations:**
- Dedicate specific time for bug fixes in next sprint
- Focus on Highest Priority bugs before Pre-FAT
- Verify old bugs - some may already be fixed but not closed
- Ensure sufficient information is available before starting fixes

**Next Steps:**
Please complete your action items before the next meeting. We'll plan bug fix allocation for the next sprint.

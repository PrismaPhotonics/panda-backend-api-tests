📊 Sprint Bugs Review Meeting

🎯 Meeting Purpose:
This is our first bugs review meeting. We'll go through the bugs from the last sprint and decide which ones we need to take into the next sprint as we start planning its content.

📋 Agenda:

We'll start by going through what happened in the last sprint - how many bugs we found, which ones got fixed, and what's still hanging around. We'll also look at the priority breakdown to see where we stand.

Then we'll figure out what bugs we should carry over to the next sprint. We'll talk about priorities, who's going to own each one, and roughly when we think they can be fixed. This is especially important since we're starting to plan the next sprint's content.

Finally, we'll spend a few minutes reflecting on what we learned and what we could do better next time.

👥 Participants:
• QA Team Lead (Roy) - Meeting Facilitator
• QA Engineers (Tomer, Ron)
• Product Owner (if relevant)
• Tech Lead / Backend Lead (if there are critical bugs)

⏱️ Meeting Duration: 30-45 minutes

📝 Required Preparations Before Meeting:
• Roy: Prepare updated bug list from the last sprint
• Roy: Prepare statistics (how many bugs found/fixed/remain open)
• Roy: Identify trends and common bug types
• Roy: Prepare recommended bug list for next sprint
• All Participants: Review bug list before the meeting

✅ Expected Outcomes:
• Prioritized bug list for next sprint
• Decisions on bugs that weren't fixed (what to do with them)
• Insights and learnings from the last sprint
• Clear action items with owners and target dates

📌 Notes:
The original time for this meeting should be on Sunday of the week where the sprint ends and the new sprint starts. We'll document decisions and update Jira with action items after the meeting.

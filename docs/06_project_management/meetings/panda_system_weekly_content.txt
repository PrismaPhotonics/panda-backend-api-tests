  Positives
  The customer wants to move forward with site installation and SAT!
  The customer sees how much more value there is in Drop 2
  The customer was impressed with our data visualization vs SES
  We reached the deadline on time and with a quality product
  What was the outcome of the FAT?
  Negatives
  There was a lack of customer and expectations management
  There were several bugs discovered, which required us to fix in an immediate fashion
  We were tested on scenarios we did not know were relevant (high stress)
  We lacked a full characterization of the performance envelope and system limitations

--- Slide 15 ---
  Post-installation issues surfaced — not seen during development or QA
  → Stability gaps emerged only in A1 field conditions
  Reproducing issues in-house has been difficult
  → Limits our ability to debug and resolve effectively
  All issues originate from Interrogator + Analyzer
  → Suggests broader system gaps, rather than isolated bugs
  2 Main Driving Factors
  No QA coverage on the Interrogator and Analyzer units + Panda Backend
  Increased complexity from hardening
  Implication - Inability to complete SAT
  Leading To…………..
  Context

--- Slide 16 ---
  The team worked hard, both day and night,
  Building Panda with all their might.
  They passed the test, no flaw in sight,
  Their teamwork strong, their code just right!
  🐼🎉
  Grateful for each and every hand,
  Together we’ve built something grand!
  ❤
  Now on to the next, with a push and a shove,
  With our eyes on the goal –  Monkey Dove! 			🐒🕊️
  Thank You Panda Team!
